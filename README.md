# ms-parcel-order ðŸ“¦

ms-parcel-order is a microservice dedicated to handling parcel order operations (create, update, query, cancel, etc.) within a larger logistics / delivery ecosystem. Itâ€™s designed to be modular, robust, and easy to integrate with other services (e.g. identity, delivery, payments).

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Parcel Order Management:** Create, update, query, and cancel parcel orders.
*   **Modular Design:** Easy to integrate with other microservices in a logistics ecosystem.
*   **Robust & Scalable:** Designed for reliability and performance.
*   **Microservice Architecture:**  Follows microservice principles for independent deployment and scaling.
*   **Java-based:** Leverages the maturity and stability of the Java ecosystem.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher.
*   **Gradle:**  Used for building and managing dependencies (version managed by Gradle Wrapper).
*   **A suitable IDE:** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
*   **(Optional) Docker:**  For containerization and deployment.
*   **(Optional) Database:** A database instance, if persistence is enabled.

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/novruzoveldar/ms-parcel-order.git
    cd ms-parcel-order
    ```

2.  **Build the project using Gradle:**

    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```

    Alternatively, you can build the JAR file and run it directly:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean build
    java -jar build/libs/ms-parcel-order.jar
    ```

4.  **Configure Database (Optional):**

    If your application requires a database connection, configure the necessary properties in `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.  For example:

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/parcel_db
    spring.datasource.username=your_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_password
    ```

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

(Detailed API documentation will be provided separately, including endpoints for creating, updating, querying, and cancelling parcel orders.)

**Example Request (Create Parcel Order):**

```json
{
  "senderId": "user123",
  "recipientId": "user456",
  "deliveryAddress": "123 Main St, Anytown",
  "weight": 5.0,
  "description": "Fragile items"
}
```

**Example Response (Create Parcel Order):**

```json
{
  "orderId": "order789",
  "status": "CREATED",
  "deliveryEstimate": "2024-01-20"
}
```
